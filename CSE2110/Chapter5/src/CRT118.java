		   1. The purpose of a loop structure is to execute a set of statements over and over again based on a condition/situation.
		   2. While statement evaluates the condition before the statements are executed. A do-while statement evaluates the condition after the first execution of a loop.
		   3. The Review Prompter
		   4. a) is a loop which continues forever
		      b) The two types of errors can lead to a infinite loop or syntax error such as a semicolon after the
		      condition and also a logic error, such as the condition of a loop always remaining true.
		      c) Overflow occurs when there are not enough bits to store the number.
		   5. It will execute 60 times
		   6. This would not become an infinite loop. It does not matter if there is an initial value of x.
		   7. A counter is useful for keeping track of the number of times a user enters a value or types a password.
		   A counter is initialized when it is declared and incremented by a fixed amount.An accumulator is useful for summing score totals or keeping track of inventory totals.
		   An accumulator is incremented by varying amounts each time the set of statements execute
		   8. for (int i = 3; i <= 10; i++) {
		   
		           total +=i:
		           
		         }
		   9. Two factors that should be considered when determining which loop structure to use are whether the number of
		   times the loop will be executed is fixed and whether the loop  should be executed at least once.
